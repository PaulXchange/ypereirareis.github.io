# About me

Hi! I am *Yannick Pereira-Reis*, and I'm a full stack web developer (Symfony2, AngularJs) in [Lyon (France)](http://www.lyon.fr/page/accueil.html).

<img class="img-center" src="../../assets/images/avatar.png" alt="Yannick Pereira-Reis">

I'm passionate about IT and particularily about web development for almost 10 years.
Indeed, I started playing with [PHP](http://php.net/),
[Javascript](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript),
[HTML](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language)
and [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) when I was in high school.

Currently, I still work with PHP, Javascript or even CSS, but I also use more tools or frameworks helping me to do my daily work:

* Symfony2
* AngularJs
* ReactJs
* Vagrant
* Jenkins
* PhpStorm
* Git/Gitlab
* Less
* Grunt
* Gulp
* Docker

Except for IT, I'm also interested in many others things such as:

* Cooking
* Photography
* Cinema
* Mountain bike

I like to learn from others, and I like to share my knowledge and experience, that's why I've created this website.

I hope you'll enjoy reading [my articles](/). Don't hesitate to leave comments.
